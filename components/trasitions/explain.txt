Transitions (How the change happens over time)
     Transitions are the effects that control how animations happen, think of them as the rules for how an element moves or changes.
     Transitions define how the change occurs â€” the timing, speed, and easing of the transformation.

     It controls:
        Duration (how long the animation takes)
        Easing / type (how it accelerates or decelerates or the speed curve of the animation)
        Delay (when it starts or how long to wait before starting the animation)
        Repeat behavior (looping or mirroring)

Ease
 easeIn --> started very slow then increase the speed
 easeOut --> opp to easeIn started with speed and then become slow
 anticipate --> go slightly backward which is less that       
                "backIn" and come forward
 backIn --> just go backward slightly and come forward
 linear --> same speed from starting to ending
