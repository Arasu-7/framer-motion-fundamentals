Variants
  Variants are a way to define different states or styles for our animations in a more organized way, Think of them as predefined animations setups that we can switch between easily.

1.Define Variants
  Create a set of named styles (like "hidden", "visible") that describe how the element should look or behave in each state.

2.Use Variants
  Apply these variants to our animated component, making it easy to switch between states without repeating
